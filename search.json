    "text": "Context\nThe Common Wall Lizard (Podarcis muralis), a small lizard native to Europe, has become a conspicuous new resident in many parts of British Columbia. Since its introduction to Vancouver Island in the 1970s from a small founding population, the lizard rapidly expanded. Its range has grown exponentially, now covering a large portion of the island and with satellite populations appearing on the mainland and surrounding islands.\nThis exploration stems from my interest in putting together a CIRTA grant proposal together with some folks at UBC to study the dynamics of this invasion. The abstract of the proposal was as follows:\n\nCanada’s harsh winters have historically acted as a natural barrier to many invasive animal species that flourish elsewhere. However, climate change is shifting these thermal boundaries, putting ecosystems that were once safe at risk. Predicting poleward range expansion is challenging because standard correlative methods often omit factors such as physiology, behavior, and the ability for local adaptation, which can help invasive animals succeed in seemingly unsuitable climates. Therefore, there is an urgent need for mechanistic frameworks that go beyond correlation to improve predictions of invasive spread. I propose to develop such a framework using the invasion of the common wall lizard (Podarcis muralis) on Vancouver Island as a model system. Despite apparent mismatches in climate for this Mediterranean ectotherm, P. muralis has rapidly expanded across British Columbia since its introduction in 1970. Now present on the Canadian mainland, it poses a serious ecological threat by outcompeting native reptiles and disrupting local food webs through insect predation. Based at the University of British Columbia, I will first assess the current range and traits of the invading lizards. In partnership with Dr. Katie Marshall and Dr. Chris Harley, I will then use ecophysiological modeling to understand how local climates and habitats influence P. muralis’s physiology and behavior. These insights will be incorporated into a hierarchical Bayesian framework, developed with Dr. Marie Auger-Methé, to discern the mechanisms underlying the spread of P. muralis while rigorously accounting for observational biases and spatiotemporal autocorrelations. Beyond generating habitat suitability maps to forecast the wall lizard’s future spread, this research will establish a transferable, scalable framework for modeling the colonization of high-latitude regions by non-native ectotherms. Ultimately, the proposed framework will provide a mechanistic basis for assessing invasion risks across Canada’s shifting latitudinal gradients, including the increasingly vulnerable Arctic and sub-Arctic regions."

    "text": "Data exploration\nBelow, I explore some data I obtained from iNaturalist to visualize the expansion of Podarcis muralis in BC. The data includes observations of the species, with associated metadata such as location and date of observation.\n\n\nRead and clean data\n# read data\npodarcis &lt;- read.csv(\"podarcis-obs-bc.csv\")\n\n# remove observations with missing coordinates\npodarcis &lt;- podarcis |&gt;\n  filter(!is.na(longitude) & !is.na(latitude)) |&gt;\n  mutate(year = year(ymd_hms(time_observed_at))) |&gt;\n  mutate(month = month(ymd_hms(time_observed_at))) |&gt;\n  filter(!is.na(year)) |&gt;\n  filter(longitude &lt; -122)\n\n# sort by year\npodarcis &lt;- podarcis[order(-podarcis$year), ]\n\n\nNext, I use the function ne_countries() from the rnaturalearth package to get the country borders for Canada and the USA, which I will use as a base layer for plotting the observations.\n\n\nGet country borders for plotting\n# get canada border\ncanada_border &lt;- ne_countries(\n  country = \"canada\",\n  scale = \"large\",\n  returnclass = \"sf\"\n)\n\n# get usa border\nusa_border &lt;- ne_countries(\n  country = \"united states of america\",\n  scale = \"large\",\n  returnclass = \"sf\"\n)\n\n\nWith all that, I plot the observations of Podarcis muralis over space, using the country borders as a base layer.\n\n\nPlot observations over space\nggplot() +\n  geom_sf(data = canada_border, fill = \"lightgray\", color = \"black\") +\n  geom_sf(data = usa_border, fill = \"lightgray\", color = \"black\") +\n  geom_point(data = podarcis, aes(x = longitude, y = latitude, color = year)) +\n  scale_color_viridis(option = \"viridis\", discrete = FALSE) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    panel.background = element_rect(fill = \"lightblue\"),\n    panel.border = element_rect(fill = NA),\n    panel.grid = element_blank()\n  ) +\n  coord_sf(xlim = c(-126, -122), ylim = c(48, 50.5)) +\n  labs(color = \"Year\") +\n  theme(axis.title = element_blank())\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt looks like the origin of the invasion is located in southern Vancouver Island. Expansion proceeds northwards and eastwards towards the mainland. It seems to have gone all around the straight of Georgia and not by island-hopping through the Gulf Islands. As of recent years, it seems to have gone all the way to the mainland and is now present in the city of Vancouver.\nBelow I plot the number of observations per year to visualize the temporal expansion of the species.\n\n\nPlot observations over time\npodarcis |&gt;\n  group_by(year) |&gt;\n  summarise(count = n()) |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = count)) +\n  geom_line() +\n  geom_point() +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(x = \"Year\", y = \"Number of Observations\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs with most iNaturalist data, there is a strong bias towards recent year.\nLastly, I plot the observations by month, standardized by year to visualize the seasonal pattern of observations.\n\n\nPlot observations by month\npodarcis |&gt;\n  group_by(year, month) |&gt;\n  summarise(count = n()) |&gt;\n  group_by(year) |&gt;\n  mutate(relative_count = count / sum(count)) |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = month, y = year, fill = relative_count)) +\n  geom_tile() +\n  geom_text(aes(label = count), size = 3, color = \"white\") +\n  scale_fill_viridis() +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = 1:12, labels = month.abb, expand = c(0, 0)) +\n  scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0, 0), breaks = seq(2005, 2025, 1)) +\n  labs(x = \"Month\", y = \"Year\", fill = \"Proportion\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLooks like it peaks in April and again in August-September, although with some year-to-year variation specially between 2019 and 2025 when there is full data coverage."
